FFR: Forked For Reference  
This is one of several repos I've found while searching across the web for help with various technical hurdles. Sometimes I come across a repo that's so good that I'm going to preserve it in my own account for future reference (FFR, forked for reference, filed for reference, for future reference)
#
How I found it: I came across this repo while searching for details on R plot margins, but found this wonderful resource.
Why: Just like the teaching repos from mgimond, this one is fantastic. Kudos to ndphillips. I'm keepin' this one for reference.

This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "Get Started" at https://bookdown.org/ for how to compile this example.

You can find the preview of this example at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown-demo/
